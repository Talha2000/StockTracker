# Stock Tracker


### About This Project

The Stock Tracker application was initially created as a project to deepen my understanding of React. Inspired by WealthSimple's intuitive and user-friendly stock tracking interface, I aimed to design a similar tool that simplifies monitoring stock data.

This application uses the Finnhub REST API to fetch real-time data for various stock symbols, providing users with up-to-date stock information. By working on this project, I aimed to enhance my skills in React while building a tool that reflects the clean and efficient design principles seen in leading financial platforms.

<strong>Important: </strong> The graphing feature is currently disabled as it requires data available only through Finnhub's premium subscription.

### Features
- Fetch stock data using various stock symbols.
- Real-time updates on stock information. (Realistically this would be implemented with the paid version)

### Future Improvements

- Add Graphing Feature
  - Re-enable the graphing functionality by integrating a premium Finnhub subscription or an alternative data source.
- Expand Data Analysis
  - Implement additional analytical tools to provide more in-depth stock performance insights.
- Refine Dashboard Styling
  - Enhance the visual design of the dashboard to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
- Notifications
  - Integrate a notification system to alert users about significant stock changes or news.
