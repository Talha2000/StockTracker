# Stock Tracker


### About this Project:
This is a stock tracker application designed for personal use. The project uses the Finnhub REST API to return data associated with any stock symbol.

The Finnhub REST api accpets form-encoided request bodies and returns a response in JSON-encoded responses while returning proper HTTP responses and verbs.

This project currently uses the free limit which allows us to make 30 api calls/second.

<strong> The graphing feature will not work anymore. The data required to create these graphs are locked behind Finnhub's premimum subscription.<strong>
